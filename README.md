# RoboticArm
This code was created using Code Composer Studio for use on Texas Instruments Tiva C launchpad (TM4C123GH6PMI / TM4C123GXL). It includes a trivial solution to the inverse kinematic equations of a 4DOF robotic arm. It also includes a software debounce for mechanical button presses (micro switches). The code is semi sluggish / messy and could do with some improvement (multi-threading, general clean up etc) but I figured I may as well post it as I really struggled to find anything like this at the start of this project, so I hope it helps.
